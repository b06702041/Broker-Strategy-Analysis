# Broker-Strategy-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the investment strategy of foreign brokers in Taiwan. We first study the transaction patterns of UBS Taiwan, the branch of foreign broker UBS which is located in Taiwan and is in charge of all transcations under Taiwanese financial market. We choose the trascation data of TW stock 2388 and 2498 due to the excellent transaction performance on these two stocks; that is, UBS Taiwan buy these stocks at the relatively low prices and sell them at the relatively high prices most of the time.

We assume that UBS Taiwan constructed one specific investment strategy for each stock and that the strategies did not be revised within the observation period. Then, we use three models to investigate the patterns which are OLS Model, Logistic Regression Model, and Random Froest Model. The result is recorded in "report.pptx" file.
